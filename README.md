# wp-updater

Manual plugin updater for advanced users

## Overview

This plugin allows you to update plugins from a ZIP file easily, using the built-in logic from WordPress but giving you more control over the process.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.x
- PHP 5.6+

## Installation

Clone/download the repo and install the plugin by unziping the contents of the zip into the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your WP installation, rename the resulting folder to `wp-updater` and activate it through the WordPress admin dashboard.

Once installed you will see a 'Manual update' entry on the left-side menu under 'Plugins', click it and you will see the options page. There you will be able to specify on which plugins the **Manual update** command will be available.

Then just head up to 'Plugins' and hover the element you want to update, then click the **Manual update** action and wait until you're redirected to select the ZIP package, then click **Update plugin** and wait for the process to finish.

Profit!
